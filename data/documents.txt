# Lunar Rover Mission Guidelines
The primary objective is autonomous exploration and sample collection on the lunar surface.
All operations must prioritize battery conservation during eclipse periods.

# Navigation Protocols
1. Autonomous Pathfinding: Avoid craters > 2m depth.
2. Communication: Maintain Line-of-Sight with Relay Orbiter.
3. Keep-Out Zones: Historic landing sites are strictly off-limits (500m buffer).

# Power Management
- Solar arrays must be deployed when sun elevation > 5 degrees.
- Enter 'Hibernation' mode if battery drops below 20%.

# Sample Collection
- Target regolith rich in Helium-3.
- Drill depth maximum: 50cm.
- Abort drilling if torque exceeds 80Nm.
