# Industrial Safety Protocols: Hazardous Material Monitoring
Compliance Standard: ISO-45001 / OSHA 1910.119 (Process Safety Management)

# 1. Operational Thresholds
- **Temperature**: Maintain containment vessel between 15°C and 45°C.
  - *Warning limit*: >50°C.
  - *Critical limit*: >65°C requires immediate cooling flush.
- **Pressure**: Normal operating range 10-15 bar.
  - *Trip limit*: >18 bar triggers automatic relief valve.

# 2. Anomaly Detection Guidelines
- **Leak Detection**: Chemical sensors must poll every 500ms. 
  - Trace levels (>5ppm) initiate 'Investigation' state.
  - High levels (>50ppm) initiate 'Emergency Evacuation'.
- **Vibration Analysis**: Continuous monitoring of pump bearings.
  - Sudden spike (>3g) indicates potential mechanical failure.

# 3. Emergency Response
- In case of "Confirmed Leak":
  - Activate containment doors.
  - Trigger site-wide alarm.
  - Notify Hazardous Response Team (HazMat).
- **Power Loss Protocol**: Switch to UPS, gracefully shut down non-critical feeds, maintain sensor grid.
